{"text": "Have you ever said that sentence? In my recent experience, this sentence is coming up more and more. After all, the Internet has  incredible information, if only it could be downloaded and processed \u2013 just think of how valuable it could be?Web data mining is a growing field which can provide powerful insights to help drive sales, understand customers, meet mission goals, and create new business opportunities.In this blog series, I\u2019ll be discussing multiple use cases as well as\u00a0essential data mining tools\u00a0and techniques for harvesting Internet data to support business analytics and intelligence. I\u2019ll cover how to:In this first part of the series, let\u2019s have a high-level look at some business use cases for extracting web data and how to identify the right data for your needs from the \u201cdata ocean.\u201dAt Search Technologies, we\u2019ve been helping customers extract data from the Internet almost since our company was founded. And the use cases are endless. Here are some examples:Learn more about your customerLearn more about your competitorsFind new customers and sales targetsLearn more about the governmentFind\u00a0things that are being sold and the people who sell themSupplement your internal offerings with external contentTranslate between external language and internal languageWatch what people are saying about youSome example customer projects with which Search Technologies has been involved include:If you have any questions about these use cases or are looking to implement your own web data mining initiatives,  for further discussions.\u00a0For most of us, it\u2019s impractical to download \u00a0the data on the web. Therefore, you must first identify the data sources you want to target. Data, of course, covers a very wide range of quality, volume, applicability, and accessibility.- These are websites\u00a0willing to sell you their data.- All have APIs for searching, filtering, and downloading content. Their available data\u00a0includes news stories (from large and small news organizations around the world, both global and local), company reports, annual reports, financial filings, worldwide patents, marketing and market reports, corporate communications and so on.- Industry coding:  (North American Industry Classification System)\u00a0and  (Standard Industry Classification)- Job coding \u2013  (SOC)- Of course, you can manually identify web pages (\u201cseed URLs\u201d) for a crawler to crawl.- Or, you can get a set of websites from a search engine, for example,  or  (note that there is a cost for more than 100 or so searches per day). The websites returned by these search engines can then be crawled with a web crawler.- Finally, you can also get seed URLs from other data sets, such as Wikidata, Twitter, and Reddit.Once you\u2019ve identified the sources from which you need the data, the next step would be using available data mining tools and techniques for acquiring the content effectively. I\u2019ll discuss this step in the next part of my blog series.
